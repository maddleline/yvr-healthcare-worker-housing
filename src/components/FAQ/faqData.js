      question: "I'm not a healthcare worker, can I apply for housing?",
      answer:
        "This service is primarily for healthcare workers who carry the highest risk of contracting COVID-19. However, we understand that all essential workers carry some risk and might be seeking temporary, low-cost housing. If you are concerned about exposing your household to COVID-19, we encourage you to apply.",

    {
      question: "Can I list my condo?",
      answer:
        "Condos are appropriate to list, so long as the unit itself is not shared. Common areas in the building should be kept as clean and safe as possible to prevent the spread of the virus.",

    {
      question: "Can I use this service to find long-term housing?",
      answer:
        "Our service is only intended to support healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Property owners are listing their units at unprecedented rates in light of these extraordinary circumstances.  Please do not contact property owners with the intention of securing low-cost accommodation indefinitely.",

      question:
        "My unit doesn’t have in-suite laundry, should I still list it?",
      answer:
        "While having in-suite laundry makes it easier for healthcare workers to reduce the risk of exposure to others, a unit without it may still be helpful to healthcare workers.  We encourage you to list your unit as an option for healthcare workers to consider.",

      question:
        "Can I make a donation of money or supplies to healthcare workers?",
      answer: `Unfortunately, we do not have the capacity to accept or distribute donations.  We recommend making donations through other services, such as <a href="https://ca.gofundme.com/f/help-covid19-coming-together-vancouver" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coming Together Vancouver</a>.`,

      question: "Isn't Airbnb already doing this?",
      answer:
        "Listing a property on Airbnb is an involved process that takes a number of steps. We offer a simpler and less formal process so that property owners can be connected with healthcare workers faster.",

    {
      question:
        "Aren’t hotels already offering free accommodation to healthcare workers?",
      answer:
        "We applaud the generous offers made by these hotels and organizations! However, hotel rooms often lack amenities that healthcare workers need, such as a kitchen/kitchenette and laundry facilities.  In addition, most hotels offering rooms are located in the downtown core, and are therefore not helpful to those who work farther out of town.",
